This video showcases only the boss's functions, without considering aspects such as player or enemy health. 
The goal is to demonstrate the different mechanics that make up the boss's behavior, including attack patterns, chasing,
special abilities, and triggered events during combat. The entire system is implemented using Behavior Trees and Blackboards, 
with decorators, services, and custom tasks managing each action in a modular and organized way.
